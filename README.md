# Deriving the Ontological Foundation of Field Theories Using Classical Logic: Addressing Hilbert’s Sixth Problem
While the foundations of general relativity (GR) and quantum field theory (QFT) are consistent, there are tensions within specific models. For example, standard QFTs are formulated on a fixed spacetime background, whereas GR treats spacetime geometry as dynamic. However, it is these specific models that have been numerically verified, so we want to be able to unite them on the same ontological structure without losing their numerical precision. Thus, rather than assuming the ontological meaning of variables, we logically derive them from a single axiomatic system (eq. 1), and this allows us to alter the ontological structure on which each theory depends until they are the same. The method is outlined as follows: 

* Use P(Z) <-iff-> E(Z) (fully defined in section 2) to derive the meaning of Space and time using classical logic.
* Derive field equations, that represent existence as a function of Space and time (ontology).
* Construct a universal ontology, referred to as U, tied to these ontological field equations such that all known phenomena share a common mechanism (a single ontological field).
* Tie the gravitational, scalar, fermion, and gauge fields to U while preserving numerical predictions.
  
The axiomatic system previously mentioned is developed by adding axioms to the framework of mathematics. These axioms of course do not interact with the mathematical framework, but it shows that the system uses the same rules of inference for all conclusions. When we apply this framework to the edge cases in physics like singularities, while the mathematical equations break down, the logic carries through telling us how to correct the mathematics to avoid paradoxes.

This paper incorporates concepts in logic, philosophy (including ontology), mathematics, and physics, and because of this it has been difficult to find specialists to review it in its entirety. However, isn't it reasonable to say that logic (not just mathematics) is what ties different fields in academics together? If so, then these fields should be more cohesive than I am aware of them currently being. This framework therefore points us in what I believe to be the correct direction.

## History
* This research combines ontology, physics, the mathematical theorems used in science, and aspects of philosophy into a single axiomatic system, and because of this, it was coined "The Framework of Everything" (FOE) by Dr. Steve Schortz. However, this title seems to have caused some issues, so I started using more descriptive ones (this is partly why the name has changed significantly over time).
* I started this research near the end of 2023, and formalized it in 2024-2025.
