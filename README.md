# Deriving-GR-and-QFT-from-Classical-Logic
According to [Wilce](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2024/entries/qt-quantlog/) and [Schurz](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-021-03367-2), there isn’t a single unifying logic from which the entirety of modern physics can be collectively understood. According to the definition of formal systems by Smullyan ("Theory of Formal Systems"), without a unifying logic there isn’t any way to form non-mathematical conclusions (e.g., ontology, explanations) within physics that give a coherent description of reality across all theories (space, time, and quantization are not treated uniformly across GR and QFT). It is therefore necessary to establish a single formal system from which physics can be axiomatically derived, as proposed by [David Hilbert](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03599) in his sixth problem.

## Foundations of Physics - Publication Status
* Submitted to Foundations of Physics (journal) on 01/13/2026.
* "Ready for Editorial Assignment" on 01/14/2026.
* "Rejected" on 2/11/2026 (Median until first decision is currently 19 days): I am more interested in truth than being correct. For this reason, I submitted my 12-page axiomatic derivation to Foundations of Physics on Jan 13, 2026, as this journal is highly respected. It sat as "ready for editorial assignment" until Feb 11 when it was rejected with an empty explanation section; no technical critique, no mention of an error in Eq. 72, just silence. This by no means implies that I am correct, but it makes the whole point of the journal rather meaningless (to me) if dedicated people can't get an answer (no, rejection without an answer is not an answer). Effectively you read until you find an error (if there is one) and you point to it. The only conclusion that I am personally able to make is that Foundations of Physics is where logic doesn't logic. If you are a reviewer or a reader and you can correct me on this then please do so. Anyone is welcome to point out an error in my work. 

## History
* This research combines ontology, physics, the mathematical theorems used in science, and aspects of philosophy into a single axiomatic system, and because of this, it was coined "The Framework of Everything" (FOE) by Dr. Steve Schortz. However, this title seems to have caused some issues, so I started using more descriptive ones (this is why the name has changed significantly over time).
* I started putting this research together in 2023, and formalized it in 2024-2025. Due to the mathematics-first approach that physicists generally take, convincing them that every coherent field takes a logic-first approach has been an uphill battle (although mathematics is derived using logic, these approaches are not the same). For this reason I have had to spend significant time revising it in ways that "click" with a physacist.
