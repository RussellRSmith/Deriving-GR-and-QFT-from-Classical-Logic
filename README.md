# Deriving-GR-and-QFT-from-Classical-Logic
According to [Wilce](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2024/entries/qt-quantlog/) and [Schurz](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-021-03367-2), there isn’t a single unifying logic from which the entirety of modern physics can be collectively understood. According to the definition of formal systems by Smullyan ("Theory of Formal Systems"), without a unifying logic there isn’t any way to form non-mathematical conclusions (e.g., ontology, explanations) within physics that give a coherent description of reality across all theories (space, time, and quantization are not treated uniformly across GR and QFT). It is therefore necessary to establish a single formal system from which physics can be axiomatically derived, as proposed by [David Hilbert](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03599) in his sixth problem. 

## Publication Status
### Due to the rigorous nature of the article, any academic journal must be willing to either formally negate a claim within this research (I can always be wrong), or publish the article within a reasonable time frame.
* Submitted to Foundations of Physics (journal) on 01/13/2026.
* "Ready for Editorial Assignment" on 01/14/2026.
### Reasons for accepting or rejecting 
* Currently too early to have any.

## History
* This research combines ontology, physics, the mathematical theorems used in science, and aspects of philosophy into a single axiomatic system, and because of this, it was coined "The Framework of Everything" (FOE) by Dr. Steve Schortz. However, this title seems to have caused some issues, so I started using more descriptive ones (this is why the name has changed significantly over time).
* I started putting this research together in 2023, and formalized it in 2024-2025. Due to the mathematics-first approach that physicists generally take, convincing them that every coherent field takes a logic-first approach has been an uphill battle (although mathematics is derived using logic, these approaches are not the same). For this reason I have had to spend significant time revising it to highlight various logical errors within the field.

## Correspondence
* I am willing to document any errors on my part for the academic record, as well as give credit to those that find them.
