# Deriving-GR-and-QFT-from-Classical-Logic
In formal systems, it is necessary to have a single logic from which to derive all conclusions. Since modern physics doesn't have a unified logical framework, there is no way to form consistent conclusions that remain valid under unification. This research provides that logical framework using Raymond Smullyan's axiomatic systems.
